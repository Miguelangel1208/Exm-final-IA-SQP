85146329001,Understanding association between methylene blue dye and biosorbent: Palmyrah sprout casing in adsorption process in aqueous phase,Water Science and Engineering,16742370,,24058106,16,154-164,2023-06-01,10.1016/j.wse.2022.12.006,9,"[{'name': 'University of Jaffna', 'city': 'Jaffna', 'country': 'Sri Lanka'}]",Journal,Article,[],https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S1674237022000977,"Water pollution caused by industrial dyes has become a severe problem in the modern world. Biosorbents can be used in an eco-friendly manner to remove industrial dyes. In this study, five biosorbents were selected: palmyrah sprout casing (PSC), manioc peel, lime peel, king coconut husk, and coconut kernel. Batch adsorption experiments were conducted to identify the best biosorbent with the highest ability to adsorb methylene blue (MB) from wastewater. The detailed mechanisms of PSC used in the adsorptive removal of MB in aqueous phase were investigated. Of the five biosorbents, PSC exhibited the best removal performance with an adsorption capacity at equilibrium (qe) of 27.67 mg/g. The qe values of lime peel, king coconut husk, manioc peel, and coconut kernel were 24.25 mg/g, 15.29 mg/g, 10.84 mg/g, and 7.06 mg/g, respectively. To explain the mechanisms of MB adsorption with the selected biosorbents, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed to characterize functional properties, and isotherm, kinetic, rate-limiting, and thermodynamic analyses were conducted. The FTIR analysis revealed that different biosorbents had different functional properties on their adsorptive surfaces. The FTIR and XRD results obtained before and after MB adsorption with PSC indicated that the surface functional groups of carbonyl and hydroxyl actively participated in the removal process. According to the isotherm analysis, monolayer adsorption was observed with the Langmuir model with a determination coefficient of 0.998. The duration to reach the maximum adsorption capacity for MB adsorption with PSC was 120 min, and the adsorption process was exothermic due to the negative enthalpy change (−9.950 kJ/mol). Moreover, the boundary layer thickness and intraparticle diffusion were the rate-limiting factors in the adsorption process. As a new biosorbent for MB adsorption, PSC could be used in activated carbon production to enhance the performance of dye removal."

It is widely cultivated and consumed as food, feed, and industrial raw material, along with the emission of a large quantity of corn waste. Such abundant, renewable, and cheap wastes with unique chemical compositions can be efficiently converted into adsorbents for the elimination of dye-contaminated water. This article represents an extensive review of the use of corn/maize waste-derived adsorbents for the sequestration of dyes from aqueous media. This study addressed the utilization of corn residues, including cob, stalk, straw, husk, and silk, as precursors for adsorbents. The adsorption behaviour, mechanism, and regeneration of the studied corn adsorbent/dye systems were identified. It was observed that the most common forms of corn/maize-derived adsorbents that have been utilized for the sequestration of dyes include biosorbents, biochars, activated carbons, and composites. The highest adsorption capacity (1,682.7 mg/g) for dye (methylene blue) sequestration was obtained using a corn husk composite-based adsorbent. Important findings and future ideas are finally mentioned for the corn/maize-based materials and their application as adsorbents for dye removal."

Thereafter, the hydrochars were characterized using diverse analytical techniques, and batch experiments of methylene blue (MB) adsorption were performed under various operating conditions. The results indicated that the activated hydrochar (AH) had a larger specific surface area (862.2 m2 g-1) compared to that of its carbonaceous precursor (33.7 m2 g-1). The maximum MB sorption capacity of the hydrochar activated with potassium hydroxide was extremely high (415.8 mg g-1 at 30 °C). In addition, adsorption isotherms and kinetics were studied using experimental data fitting to further understand and describe the dynamic equilibrium, dynamic kinetics, and mechanism of MB adsorption onto the prepared hydrochars. As compared to the Freundlich isotherm model, the Langmuir isotherm model provided a better fit with the experimental data exhibiting a maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 418.78 mg g-1. The linear pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be suitable for describing the adsorptive kinetics of the hydrochar. The results demonstrated the immense potential of coffee husk waste to produce activated carbon as an alternative green hydrochar that can be applied to dye removal from wastewater as well as improvement of waste management."

Maximum experimental adsorption capacity of the bio-composite beads was calculated as 274.9 mg/g. The various process parameters such as pH, temperature and initial MB concentration optimized. It was determined that pH no significant effect on dye removal efficiency of beads while temperature and ionic strength caused a decrease on removal efficiency. The various isotherm models were applied for determine the adsorption mechanism and Freundlich isotherm model is more compatible with the experimental data. The kinetic studies showed that the adsorption of methylene blue can be well described by the fractal Brouers-Sotolongo kinetic model. The thermodynamic calculations indicated that methylene blue adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic nature.

Kinetic investigation revealed that the adsorption of dyes followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The results suggested that AC was effective to remove dyes, especially MB, from aqueous solutions. Desorption studies found that chemisorption by the adsorbent might be the major mode of dye removal. Fourier transform infrared results suggested that dye molecules were likely to combine with the O-H and P=OOH groups of AC."

The materials were characterized by means of XRD, N2 physisorption, Mössbauer spectroscopy and H2 pulse titration. The composites showed very good catalytic performances for methylene blue organic dye oxidation. The small goethite particles are the predominant iron oxide phase in the composites. The apparent surface area is quite high and is not very affected after iron impregnation. ESI-MS studies revealed that the dye removal occurs through a Fenton-type system by the composite whereas for the activated carbon the dye removal occurs mainly via adsorption. The iron leaching from the catalysts was negligible, less than 0.5 ppm, which evidences the occurrence of a heterogenous oxidation process. The catalyst was very active for methylene blue oxidation and could be repeatedly used for at least 5 cycles. The catalyst was also active in the oxidation of other organic compounds, such as caffeine and atrazine."

Methylene blue and crystal violet were the two dyes investigated in the present study. Three activated carbons were produced from the exclusive sewage sludge (referred to as DS), the sludge with the additive of coconut husk (DC) and sludge with the additive of peanut shell (DP) respectively. They were characterized by their surface area and porosity and their surface chemistry structure. Adsorption studies were performed by the batch technique to obtain kinetic and equilibrium data. The results show that the three sludge-derived activated carbons had a developed porosity and marked content of surface functional groups. They exhibited a rapid three-stage adsorption process for both methylene blue and crystal violet. Their adsorption capacities for the two dyes were high, the carbon DP performed best in the adsorption whereas the carbon DC performed worst. It is therefore concluded that the activated carbons made from sewage sludge and its mixtures are promising for dye removal from aqueous streams."

The washed products showed reasonable surface areas with dimensions in the micropore range. Adsorption of methylene blue from aqueous solution indicated high affinity and high dye removal capacity. Low iodine numbers and methylene blue values were ascribed to the high ash content extending up to 50% of the activated carbon.
